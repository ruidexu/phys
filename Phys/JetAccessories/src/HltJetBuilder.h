/**
 * Jet building (JB) algorithm class for use in the HLT and offline.
 *
 * JB takes Particle inputs and clusters them into jets using the
 * FastJet package. Optionally, it can then correct the jet energy
 * (JEC), calculate additional information about the jet, and
 * associate tag Particles with the jets.
 *
 * Jets can be built per primary vertex or inclusively by setting
 * 'JetVrt' to true or false respectively. If built inclusively, all
 * inputs that are not banned are used to build jets. If built per PV,
 * then particles are associated to PVs if they contain one or more
 * tracks. Particles without tracks are associated to all PVs. The,
 * jets are built using the input for each PV and the PV location is
 * set as the reference point of the jet. Note that when building per
 * PV, the neutrals are double counted when considering jets from all
 * PVs.
 *
 * Particles, both neutral and charged, can be banned from the jet
 * input via locations set with the 'InputBans' property. Note that
 * the CaloClusters matched to a Track from a charged Particle are not
 * banned.
 *
 * Jets can be tagged via Particles from locations provided with the
 * 'InputTags' property. If the Particle has a vertex, the best PV to
 * vertex flight direction will be used to match it to the jet,
 * otherwise the momentum four-vector will be used. If delta R between
 * the Particle and the jet is less than the 'JetR' property, the jet
 * will be marked as tagged. This is done by setting the extra info
 * for the Particle with key Particle::FirstJetIndex + 100 + tag
 * location index. The value is set as the key of the tagging
 * Particle.
